# Python using TAM API

[![TAM - API](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=TAM&message=API&color=b51839)](https://www.triamec.com/en/tam-api.html)

This example demonstrates the use of the TAM API with Python.
With the installation of the [Python.NET package](https://pypi.org/project/pythonnet/), Python programmers have an almost seamless integration with the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR).
It allows Python code to interact with the CLR respectivelly with the TAM API.
